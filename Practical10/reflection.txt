In general, this practice was difficult. 
I learned the construction of sir Model, the production of graphics, line charts and heat maps. 
At the same time, it helped me better understand sir Model and disease spread.
I think the most important thing I've learned is the ability to think about how to build models on my own, which allows me to understand the code better.
I also thought it would be cool to build sir Heatmaps on minecraft.
